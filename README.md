# **Smart Factory Optimization: Predictive Maintenance & Workflow Automation**

## 📌 Overview
The **Smart Factory Optimization System** is an **IoT-based solution** designed to enhance manufacturing efficiency. It predicts **machine downtimes**, automates workflow optimizations, and minimizes production disruptions. By collecting real-time sensor data, the system provides actionable insights for proactive maintenance and improved factory performance.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Real-time Sensor Data Collection** – Captures temperature, vibration, and machine status.  
✅ **Data Processing & Storage** – Logs sensor data in JSON and CSV formats for further analysis.  
✅ **Predictive Maintenance** – Uses data analytics to assess failure risks and recommend maintenance.  
✅ **Visualization & Monitoring** – Displays real-time trends of sensor readings for analysis.  
✅ **Workflow Optimization** – Suggests improvements to reduce inefficiencies and prevent downtime.
